.. title:: proEQUIB Overview

`proEQUIB <https://equib.github.io/proEQUIB>` is an IDL library for plasma diagnostics and abundance analysis in nebular astrophysics.
This library has API functions written in `Interactive Data Language <http://www.harrisgeospatial.com/ProductsandSolutions/GeospatialProducts/IDL.aspx>` (IDL)/`GNU Data Language <http://gnudatalanguage.sourceforge.net/>` (GDL) programs.
It uses the `AtomNeb IDL library <https://github.com/atomneb/AtomNeb-idl>`, which can be used to determine interstellar extinctions, electron temperatures, electron densities, and ionic abundances from collisionally excited lines (CEL) 
and recombination lines (RL).

`proEQUIB <https://equib.github.io/proEQUIB>` mainly contains the follwing API functions written purely in IDL/GDL: 

* `API functions for collisionally excited lines (CEL)` have been developed based on the algorithm of the FORTRAN program `EQUIB <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ascl.soft03005H>` written in FORTRAN by `Howarth & Adams (1981) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1981ucl..rept.....H>`. The program EQUIB calculates atomic level populations and line emissivities in statistical equilibrium in multi-level atoms for different physical conditions of the stratification layers where the chemical elements are ionized. Using the IDL/GDL implementation of the program `EQUIB <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ascl.soft03005H>`, electron temperatures, electron densities, and ionic abundances are determined from the measured fluxes of collisionally excited lines.

* `API functions for recombination lines (RL)` have been developed based on the algorithm of the recombination scripts by X. W. Liu and Y. Zhang included in the FORTRAN program `MOCASSIN <https://github.com/mocassin/MOCASSIN-2.0>`. These API functiosn are used to determine ionic abundances from recombination lines for some heavy element ions.
 
* `API functions for reddening and extinctions` have been developed according to the methods of the reddening law functions from `STSDAS IRAF Package <http://www.stsci.edu/institute/softwarehardware/stsdas>`, which are used to obtain interstellar extinctions and deredden measured fluxes based on different reddening laws.


Dependencies
------------

* This package requires the following packages:

    - `The IDL Astronomy User's Library <https://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/homepage.html>`
    
    - `The AtomNeb IDL Library <https://github.com/atomneb/AtomNeb-idl>`
    
    - `IDL MCMC Hammer library <https://github.com/mcfit/idlemcee>` (currently not used!)
    
* To get this package with all the dependent packages, you can simply use ``git`` command as follows::

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/equib/proEQUIB.git


GDL Installation
----------------

*  The GNU Data Language (GDL) can be installed on

    - Linux (Fedora)::

        sudo dnf install gdl
    
    - Linux (Ubuntu)::
    
        sudo apt-get install gnudatalanguage
    
    - OS X::
    
        brew install gnudatalanguage
    
    - Windows: using the `GNU Data Language for Win32 <https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnudatalanguage-win32/>` (Unofficial Version) or compiling the `GitHub source <https://github.com/gnudatalanguage/gdl>` with Visual Studio 2015 as seen in `appveyor.yml <https://github.com/gnudatalanguage/gdl/blob/master/appveyor.yml>`.


* To setup `proEQUIB <https://equib.github.io/proEQUIB>` in GDL, add its path to ``.gdl_startup`` in the home directory::

    !PATH=!PATH + ':/home/proEQUIB/pro/'
    !PATH=!PATH + ':/home/proEQUIB/externals/misc/'
    !PATH=!PATH + ':/home/proEQUIB/externals/astron/pro/'
    !PATH=!PATH + ':/home/proEQUIB/externals/atomneb/pro/'

  Set ``GDL_STARTUP`` in ``.bashrc`` (bash)::

    export GDL_STARTUP=~/.gdl_startup

  or in ``.tcshrc`` (cshrc)::

    setenv GDL_STARTUP ~/.gdl_startup

* This package needs GDL version 0.9.8 or later.
